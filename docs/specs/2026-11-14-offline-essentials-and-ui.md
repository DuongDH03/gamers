# Spec: offline essentials, and the UI layer

- Date: 2026-11-14
- Status: **Approved by the owner (2026-11-14), being built.** Answers: parts 1
  to 5 approved as written; UI **layout A (WebView2)**
  (`docs/decisions/2026-11-14-ui-layout.md`); P pauses and Esc quits until the
  UI has a pause menu; one commit per part on `main`, then push to `origin/main`.
- Asked for: "finish implementing all of this": save and load, music, gamepad,
  pause, packaging a release, and the UI layer. Plan it, divide it among agents,
  then commit and push.
- Diagrams: `tools/make_offline_ui_diagrams.py` → `docs/images/spec-ou-*.svg`.

Six parts. Parts 1 to 5 are engine work that every game reuses, and they are
independent of each other, so four agents build them in parallel, each in its
own git worktree (wave 1). Part 6, the UI layer, needs your choice between
layout A and layout B, and it builds on wave 1, so it comes second (wave 2).

## The build plan

![Wave 1: four engine-dev agents in parallel worktrees build save/load with pause, music, gamepad, and packaging; then a merge, one review and a bench. Wave 2: UI prerequisites, then the UI backend and React screens; review, bench, commit and push](../images/spec-ou-waves.svg)

  agent 6: UI layer           (backend for A or B, React screens)
reviewer ─► bench ─► commit ─► push to origin/main
```

</details>

Each agent works on its own branch, so none can overwrite another's files.
The files several parts touch (`apps/client/main.cpp`, `games/sandbox`) get
small, separate edits that I merge. Every part must, on its own branch, build
on `mingw` and `msvc` with zero warnings and pass `ctest`.

---

## Part 1. Save and load

**What:** write the game to a file and read it back, from a key or later a
menu. Each game reuses this; it decides only *when* to save.

- **What's in a save:** the World's state (entities, tick, random state,
  players), as snapshots already serialise it (`write_world_state`), with a
  header: magic `SCRS`, save-format version, scene name, scene content hash,
  tick, and the game's name. The level is not stored; it comes from the scene
  file, as on every start.
- **New in core:** `core/save.h`. `write_save(world, scene_name, scene_hash,
  game_name, bytes)` and `read_save(bytes, header, world_from_scene, error)`.
  Reading starts from the World built from the scene and overlays the saved
  state, so rules and level stay the scene's.
- **Who saves (Rule 5):** the server, because it holds the true World.
  Offline that is the embedded server. `Server::world()` is read-only.
- **Loading (Rule 1):** like hot reload, it is construction, not mutation.
  `Server::load_state(World)` replaces the World between ticks, and clients
  get a new Welcome and a full snapshot.
- **Checks:** wrong magic or version, or a different scene name: refused with
  a message. Same scene name but a changed scene file (another hash): loaded,
  with a HUD warning, because levels change during development.
- **Where:** `SDL_GetPrefPath("Scraps", <game>)` (on Windows,
  `%APPDATA%\Scraps\<game>\`); with no SDL (headless), `./saves/`. One slot
  for now, `quick.sav`. The app decides the path; core only turns bytes into a
  World and back.
- **Keys (offline only):** F5 saves, F9 loads. The dedicated server gets
  `--load <file>`, and `--save <file>` on clean shutdown.
- **Tests:** a save round-trips byte for byte; a truncated, corrupted or
  other-version file is refused; another scene is refused; a changed scene
  warns. Offline: play, save, play on, load, and the World equals the saved
  one. After a load, the client's prediction restarts from the new snapshot.

## Part 2. Music

**What:** background music in any common format, looping, with fades. Today
sounds are capped at 30 s, because they are decoded completely into memory.
A 3-minute song would be about 70 MB decoded, so music has to stream.

- **Streaming in core:** `core/music.h`, `MusicStream`. It opens OGG, MP3,
  FLAC or WAV (recognised by content, like sounds) with the pull decoders
  already vendored (stb_vorbis, dr_mp3, dr_flac, dr_wav). It decodes a few
  thousand frames at a time, converts to 48 kHz stereo, and wraps to the
  start when looping. All buffers are sized when the stream opens, so mixing
  allocates nothing.
- **Mixer:** a music channel next to the effect voices. `play_music(stream,
  volume, fade_in)`, `stop_music(fade_out)`; starting a new track crossfades.
  `music_volume` is separate from effects.
- **Scenes:** `music <path> [volume V]` plays when the scene loads, and keeps
  playing across hot reloads if the path is unchanged.
- **Decoding runs on the main thread** while mixing ahead, as effects do now:
  about 60 ms of audio per frame, well under a millisecond.
- **Sandbox:** `tools/make_sandbox_sounds.py` composes a short original
  chiptune loop (about 30 s) as `music.ogg`. Every scene plays it.
- **Tests:** for each format, the first seconds streamed equal the same file
  fully decoded; a loop wraps with no gap or click; crossfade volumes follow
  the curve; mixing with music allocates nothing; a missing or broken file
  gives an error, never a crash.

## Part 3. Gamepad

**What:** play with a controller. Input gets the first connected gamepad;
local multiplayer with several pads is out of scope.

- **`Input`:** `GamepadButton` (south, east, west, north, d-pad, start, back,
  shoulders, stick clicks), `GamepadAxis` (left x/y, right x/y, triggers),
  `gamepad_connected()`, and button down, pressed and released this frame,
  latched like keys. Axes are −1..1, raw; the dead zone belongs to Controls.
- **sdl3:** `SDL_INIT_GAMEPAD`. Open a pad when it is added, close it when it
  is removed. Button names follow SDL's positional layout (south = A on
  Xbox, Cross on PlayStation).
- **headless:** `set_axis` and `press/release(GamepadButton)` for the
  autopilot and tests.
- **Controls:** the left stick moves like WASD but analog (Move's `vec` may
  already be shorter than 1), with a radial dead zone of 0.2. The d-pad acts
  as WASD, south jumps, and start toggles pause (Part 4).
- **`GameApi` version 2:** `GameBinding` can name a gamepad button. Version 1
  modules are refused with the usual message. The sandbox binds west to
  "drop coin".
- **Tests:** stick to move direction in all three views; the dead zone; a
  tap between ticks is emitted exactly once; a pad connected mid-game; d-pad
  equals WASD.
- **Not verifiable here** without a controller plugged in: the sdl3 path is
  checked by hand by you.

## Part 4. Pause

**What:** stop the game and resume exactly where it was. Offline only; in
an online game one player can't stop everyone else's world. That would be a
design decision per game, and the server would own it.

![Pause stops ticks on the embedded server and the client together, freezes timeouts, resets the step clock on resume so there's no catch-up burst; rendering and audio continue](../images/spec-ou-pause.svg)

<details><summary>Text version</summary>

```text
P / gamepad start ─► app: paused = !paused
paused:   Server::set_paused(true)   no ticks, no snapshots, client timeouts frozen
          Client::set_paused(true)   no prediction, no inputs sent, server timeout frozen
          FixedStepClock stops counting; frames keep drawing the last world; music ducks to 40 %
resume:   both unpause, clock.reset()  ─► next tick is the one after the paused tick (no burst)
```

</details>

- **Rule 2 holds:** a pause adds no "slower" ticks. Ticks stop, then
  continue with the next tick number. The clock is reset on resume, so it
  doesn't try to catch up on the paused time.
- **Why the server needs to know:** without it, a paused client sends no
  input, and after 5 s the server drops it as gone. So both sides freeze
  their timeouts.
- **Shown:** "Paused" on the HUD (until the UI layer draws a pause menu).
  Music ducks to 40%. Effects that are already playing finish.
- **Tests:** 10 simulated seconds of pause give no ticks and no disconnect.
  Pause and resume give, after N ticks of play, a World byte-identical to a
  run that never paused. Resuming runs no burst of ticks. Online, the client
  ignores pause.

## Part 5. Packaging a release, and choosing the game

**What:** one command makes a zip that runs on a clean Windows PC, and the
apps can be built for any game under `games/`.

- **Choosing the game:** CMake option `SCRAPS_GAME` (default `sandbox`). A
  helper `scraps_add_game(<name> SOURCES ... SCENES <dir>)` makes the static
  library, the hot-reload module and the scene-folder setting. Apps include
  one generated header that returns the chosen game's `GameApi`, so
  `apps/*/main.cpp` no longer name the sandbox. A second game is a new folder
  plus `-DSCRAPS_GAME=<name>`.
- **Finding scenes at run time:** in order, `--scene-dir`, then `scenes/`
  next to the exe, then the source folder compiled in for development.
  Today only the last exists, which breaks on another PC.
- **`cmake --install` and CPack:** the zip holds `scraps_client.exe`,
  `scraps_server.exe`, `SDL3.dll`, the compiler's runtime DLLs (MinGW:
  `libstdc++-6`, `libgcc_s_seh-1`, `libwinpthread-1`, found with
  `file(GET_RUNTIME_DEPENDENCIES)`; MSVC: the VC runtime through
  `InstallRequiredSystemLibraries`), the game's `scenes/` with art, sounds
  and music, and a short `README.txt`. It is named
  `Scraps-<game>-<version>-win64.zip`.
- **Presets:** `cmake --workflow --preset release-mingw` (and
  `release-msvc`) configure, build, test and package in one go.
- **Release builds** link the game statically. No hot-reload module and no
  `--hot-game` in the zip.
- **Test:** `package_runs` installs into a temp folder and runs
  `scraps_client --headless --frames 120` from there, with `PATH` cut down to
  Windows' own folders. If a DLL is missing, it fails.

## Part 6. The UI layer (needs your choice)

**What:** menus and HUD written in React/HTML/JS, in a native exe. The first
version has: a main menu (Play, Continue = load, Quit), a pause menu
(Resume, Save, Load, Settings, Quit), the HUD (coins), and settings (music
and effects volume). It shows both kinds of UI action: game actions become
`Command`s (Rule 1), for example a "drop coin" button, and app actions such
as save, pause and quit call the app.

**Prerequisites for both layouts (agent 5):**
- `Input` gains an event list per frame (key, button, text, pointer, pad),
  plus text input on and off, so a text field gets typed characters.
- The client loop becomes a one-frame function, `ClientApp::frame(now)`, so
  a host that owns the window loop (a WebView or browser engine) can call it.
- A `UiBridge` interface: the app sends a small JSON "view model" (coins,
  paused, menu state) when it changes, and receives UI actions by name.

![Layout A: a WebView2 window owns the screen; the engine's Views still produce triangle batches, which go through shared memory to WebGL; React draws menus on top in the same page. Layout B: the sdl3 window and GPU draw the world; an offscreen browser engine renders React to a bitmap that is uploaded as a texture and drawn on top](../images/spec-ou-ui.svg)

```

</details>

| | A. WebView2 draws everything (recommended) | B. Native world, HTML overlay |
|---|---|---|
| How | New backend `webview2`: a Win32 window with a WebView2 control implements Window, Input and Renderer2D. `fill_triangles` batches and textures go to WebGL2 through a `CoreWebView2SharedBuffer`; React is in the same page. Audio stays native (SDL audio only). | Keep `sdl3`. Render React offscreen with Ultralight or CEF into a bitmap; `Renderer2D` gains `update_texture`; draw it over the world; route input to the UI first, the game second. |
| Reuse | All three Views unchanged: they already reduce everything to triangle batches and textures, which is all `Renderer2D` is. | Everything unchanged; the UI is added on top. |
| Dependencies | WebView2 runtime is part of Windows 11 (installed here, version 157); WebView2 SDK (MIT, NuGet). Node for building the React app (installed: Node 20). | Ultralight: closed source, free under a revenue limit, about 40 MB. CEF: open, about 150 MB, several processes. Plus Node. |
| Developer experience | Edge DevTools (F12) on the real game UI; Vite hot reload of React while the game runs. | DevTools only through a remote inspector; harder. |
| Costs | Windows only for the React build (the `sdl3` build stays as it is, without React UI). About one more frame of display latency through the browser compositor. | A big binary dependency; the UI bitmap is copied to the GPU every frame it changes; more glue code for input routing. |
| Rules | A new backend (Rule 3); UI actions are Commands (Rule 1). | The same. |

**Recommendation: A.** `Renderer2D` is only "textures plus triangle batches",
so a WebGL backend is small, and the world looks exactly as it does now.
Nothing proprietary or 150 MB is added, and React gets real browser tools.
The price is Windows only for the React UI, which matches how you ship
today.

**Agent 6 builds the chosen layout:**
- the backend;
- a `ui/` React app (Vite + TypeScript), built into `ui/dist` and shipped in
  the zip;
- the four screens above;
- tests: the bridge's JSON and actions, a UI action becoming a Command, and
  for A, the shared-buffer batch format round-trips.

The window itself is checked by hand by you.

## Rules check

| Rule | Effect |
|---|---|
| 1. Only `simulate` changes the World | Gamepad and UI game actions are Commands. Loading a save replaces the World between ticks, as a scene reload does (construction). Pause stops ticks; it never edits the World. |
| 2. Fixed step | Pause stops ticks and resets the clock; there is no variable step. Music streams by frame, like effects. |
| 3. No backend in core | Save, music decoding and mixing are pure core code. The gamepad comes through `Input`. The save folder and the UI are backends or apps. |
| 4. No "down" in core | The stick maps through the View, as WASD does. |
| 5. Server authority | The server saves and loads. Pause is offline only, and the server knows about it. |
| Code rules | No allocation per frame (streaming buffers are sized when a stream opens), no globals, no exceptions in core. |

## Out of scope

Several save slots and save thumbnails, cloud saves, local multiplayer with
several pads, rumble, rebinding controls in a menu, online pause or voting,
an installer (.msi), code signing, auto-update, macOS and Linux packages,
localisation.

## Questions for you

1. Approve parts 1 to 5 as written, built in parallel by four agents?
2. **UI: layout A (WebView2, recommended) or B (overlay)?** If B: Ultralight
   or CEF?
3. Esc: today it quits. With the UI, Esc should open the pause menu. Until
   then, P pauses and Esc still quits. Fine?
4. Push target: commit each part, then push to `origin/main`
   (`github.com/DuongDH03/gamers`) when everything is done. Or would you
   rather have a branch and a pull request?

## Results, parts 1 and 4

Built 2026-11-14 on branch `worktree-agent-a7919aa9ccb12285f` (agent 1).
`mingw` and `msvc` both build with zero warnings, and `ctest` passes 28 of 28
on both (114 unit test functions, 16 of them new).

**What was built**
- `core/save.h`: `write_save`, `read_save_header`, `read_save`. Format:
  magic `SCRS`, version 1, game name, scene name, scene hash, tick, the state
  size, the state (`write_world_state`), and an FNV-1a checksum of
  everything before it. `read_save` lays the state over the World built from
  the scene, and returns `kRefused` (with a message, World untouched),
  `kLoaded`, or `kSceneChanged` (loaded, warn).
- `Server`: `world()` (it already existed, read-only), `scene_name()`,
  `scene_hash()`, `load_state(World, scene name, hash)`, `set_paused`.
  `reload` and `load_state` share one private `replace_world`.
- `Client::set_paused`. `FixedStepClock::reset()`.
- `apps/common/save_game.h` (file I/O: write to `.tmp`, then rename) and
  `apps/common/pause.h` (`OfflinePause`: the one place that pauses; it
  refuses online). `sdl3::preferences_path` wraps `SDL_GetPrefPath`.
- `scraps_client`: F5 and F9 (offline) use `quick.sav` in
  `SDL_GetPrefPath("Scraps", <game>)`, or in `./saves/` when headless; P pauses
  (offline); HUD messages for saved, loaded, errors and the changed-scene
  warning, and a centred "Paused - P to resume". `// TODO(merge): duck music`
  marks where part 2's mixer ducks.
- `scraps_server --load <file>` (the save's scene unless `--scene` is
  given) and `--save <file>` (after the loop ends).

**Tests.**
- `unit_save`:
  - format: a byte-for-byte round trip; the header; every truncation refused;
    every single-byte corruption refused; another version, scene or game
    refused; a changed scene loads with a warning.
  - offline: play, save, play on, load, and the World equals the save, tick
    included; prediction restarts after a load over 50 ms latency; saved
    players who are not here are removed; a refused load changes nothing.
- `unit_pause`: 10 simulated seconds with no ticks, no snapshots, no inputs and
  no disconnect (also with the server polled while paused); byte-identical to a
  run that never paused; no burst after resuming (50 Hz frames, and a 3 s stall
  while paused); `reset()`; online, the client ignores pause.
- Smoke tests:
  - `server_save` → `server_load`: tick 30 saved, world tick 60 after 30 more.
  - `client_offline_save_pause_load`: the headless autopilot presses F5, P, P,
    F9 and prints "saves 1, loads 1, save errors 0, paused frames 60, ticks
    while paused 0".
- `no_allocation_in_hot_path` also pauses an offline game for 600 frames and
  resumes it: 0 allocations.
- Mutation check: with the server's timeout freeze or the client's "world
  replaced" handling turned off, `pause.ten_seconds_...` and
  `save.offline_save_play_load` fail.

**Deviations, and why**
- **`load_state` takes the scene name and hash too**, like `reload`. The
  World is built from the scene file as it is now. If that file changed after
  the server loaded it, clients must be told the new hash, or they would
  refuse it.
- **A load keeps the saved tick** (reload keeps the running one), so the
  World equals the saved one. The client ignores the Welcome (same scene).
  It notices the load in the next full snapshot, whose tick is lower than the
  newest one it has. That only happens after a load, because snapshots
  complete in order. The client then clears its interpolation samples and
  starts prediction over without blending. No protocol change.
- **Saved players who are not playing now are removed at the next tick.**
  Players who are playing keep their saved entity (a join of a player who
  already has one changes nothing). Rejoining players can't be matched to
  saved ones yet, so after `--load` a dedicated server keeps no players.
- **A save from another game is refused too**, not only one for another scene.
- **A checksum** was added to the header, so corruption is always caught,
  not only when the state happens to fail validation.
- **F9 resumes a paused game**, so the loaded world shows at once.
- **The headless autopilot now presses F5 (frame 240), P (frames 270 and 330)
  and F9 (frame 420)** in every offline smoke run of 600 frames. Those runs
  write `saves/quick.sav` in their working folder (the `apps` build folder).
  The dedicated test runs in a folder of its own. Under `ctest -j` the other
  smoke runs could read each other's save; they don't fail on that, and only
  the dedicated test checks the counts.

**Not done, or not verified**
- The SDL path (`%APPDATA%\Scraps\sandbox\quick.sav`) and the HUD text were
  not seen in a window; only the headless path ran.
- `--save` runs only when the loop ends (`--ticks`). Ctrl+C stops the server
  without saving. Catching Ctrl+C needs a signal flag, which is global state,
  so that is the owner's call.
- No music ducking and no gamepad start button (parts 2 and 3; see the merge
  TODO).
